* Install Unifi Controller
** Network map

#+BEGIN_SRC
internet <--->   UniFi USG <-- LAN 1 --> UniFi Controller
                      ^
                      | LAN 2
                      v
participants <---> unmanaged switch <---> wireless AP
#+END_SRC

Most of the configuration takes place on the Unifi controller.

We run the controller ourselves on Debian, with the Unifi controller software installed.
** TODO Willem: Add description of how to install unifi controller on Debian
** Mating UniFi Controller and USG
   The UniFi controller and USG may not mate (connect) automatically. For this to work,
   SSH into the USG (default username and password is ubnt:ubnt), and execute the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC ssh
mca-cli
set-inform http://ip-of-controller:8080/inform
# go to the controller web interface, login, go to the devices tab, approve the connection, and again:
set-inform http://ip-of-controller:8080/inform
#+END_SRC

** Theory of operation

   Participant flow:

   1. Participant arrives at LAN, connects PC to network
   2. Participant goes to a webpage
   3. Participant is redirected to http://portal.gepwnage.lan
   4. Participant enters his voucher and clicks "Register on network"
   5. Participant is redirected to the status page
   6. Participant has access to the network

** Configuring static DNS routes

   Edit /usr/lib/unifi/data/sites/default/config.gateway.json and configure as follows for static DNS:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
    "system": {
        "static-host-mapping": {
            "host-name": {
                "portal.gepwnage.lan": {
                    "inet": [
                        "10.13.42.3"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
#+END_SRC
