Most of the configuration takes place on the Unifi controller.

We run the controller ourselves on Debian, with the Unifi controller software installed.

** Mating UniFi Controller and USG
   The UniFi controller and USG may not mate (connect) automatically. For this to work,
   SSH into the USG (default username and password is ubnt:ubnt), and execute the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC ssh
mca-cli
set-inform http://ip-of-controller:8080/inform
# go to the controller web interface, login, go to the devices tab, approve the connection, and again:
set-inform http://ip-of-controller:8080/inform
#+END_SRC
